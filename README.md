# Online Shoppers Intention Analysis

A comprehensive clustering analysis project to segment online shoppers based on their browsing behavior and purchasing intentions using session data from e-commerce websites.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes visitor browsing patterns on e-commerce sites to distinguish between users who are merely browsing and those likely to generate revenue. Using clustering techniques, we segment users to understand different behavioral patterns and optimize business strategies.

## üéØ Objective

- Identify distinct clusters of online shoppers based on browsing behavior
- Compare clusters with the existing Revenue column for validation
- Understand characteristics of different user segments
- Provide insights for personalized marketing strategies

## üìÅ Dataset Information

The dataset contains 12,330 sessions with 18 features (10 numerical, 8 categorical) representing user behavior on an e-commerce site.

| Administrative Duration | Time spent on administrative pages | Numerical |
| Informational | Number of informational pages visited | Numerical |
| Informational Duration | Time spent on informational pages | Numerical |
| Product Related | Number of product-related pages visited | Numerical |
| Product Related Duration | Time spent on product-related pages | Numerical |
| Bounce Rate | Percentage of single-page sessions | Numerical |
| Exit Rate | Percentage of exits from the page | Numerical |
| Page Value | Average value before transaction | Numerical |
| Special Day | Closeness to special days | Numerical |
| Month | Month of the visit | Categorical |
| Operating Systems | Visitor's OS | Categorical |
| Browser | Visitor's browser | Categorical |
| Region | Geographic region | Categorical |
| Traffic Type | Traffic source | Categorical |
| Visitor Type | New, Returning, or Other | Categorical |
| Weekend | Whether visit was on weekend | Boolean |
| Revenue | Whether session ended in purchase (Target) | Boolean |
